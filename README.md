# Web-Development

Some web development projects.

I completed a web development course at udemy (this is the link for the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/web-completo/) and there a learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So I made some static web pages during that course and wanted to make them publicly available for anyone who want to study more about html, css and js.
